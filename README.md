# Maze-Runner
The project "Maze Runner" explores the intricate domain of maze-solving algorithms, focusing on the evaluation of three prominent search strategies: A*, Depth First Search (DFS), and Breadth-First Search (BFS). The main challenge involves guiding an agent through mazes, considering treasures as intermediate goals, and leading to the destination. The A* algorithm, known for its balance between efficiency and optimality, guiding an agent through the maze while optimizing pathfinding among obstacles. The project's foundation lies in the historical evolution of maze-solving algorithms, tracing back to the 1950s and progressing through the contributions of A* in 1968. A literature review explores related studies and methodologies, shedding light on the progression from traditional search algorithms to the integration of machine learning and reinforcement learning techniques. Methodologically, the project employs C++ and Java, implementing A*, DFS, and BFS algorithms to solve mazes. The unique feature involves the introduction of rewards – treasures of varying values – creating a detailed maze-solving experience. Performance metrics, including step count, node expansion, and execution time, evaluate the algorithms' efficiency in reaching both intermediate treasures and the final goal. Results from experiments reveal A* searches effectiveness in handling maze navigation complexities, outperforming DFS and BFS in steps, node expansion, and time complexity. A* search is even better because it uses memory more efficiently and can adapt well to different situations. The experiments conclude with a comprehensive comparison, indicating A* as the optimal choice for Maze Runner due to its balance between efficiency and adaptability. BFS is a feasible alternative with higher memory consumption, while DFS lags due to inefficiency.
